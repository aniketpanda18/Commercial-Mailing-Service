# Commercial-Mailing-Service

A network has to be designed for a small business organization which has 100 users. The organization hosts an e-commerce application on a server which is accessible to internet users using https and with a public IP address. 
A network for the same was designed using Cisco Packet Tracer version 8.0.0.  The requirements were emulated and tested for connectivity. A server was setup, which is accessible only on port 443 with HTTPS connectivity. Internally, department routers are interconnected for unfiltered access to the server. 
Switches are used to ensure optimal number of devices can be used with both the company network as well as the broadband network. 
Pings were used to check the connectivity and  the reachability of the 	systems 	and 	machines 	from 	all 	the 	network.
